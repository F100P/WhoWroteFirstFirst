# Using react

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About WhoWroteFirstFirst
WhoWroteFirstFirst uses youtubes api to find who wrote first first.
The project is more of a fun way for me to experiment with the api.

## Before you run
Before you run this program it is nessecary to rename "getKeysubs.js" to "getKey.js" and insert your own api key on line 2
EXAMPLE: const key = "Insert your own key here" -> const key = "ASF789ghg87_KJH798HGHhhHHj"

## Currently working on
Atm im working on style and functionallity 

*Style
Get everything to look like its not a website from 2000

**functionallity
Youtubes api is not currently supporting a simple way to access the first comment ever written on a video. nor does it support collecting  all comments from a video... NOR Does it support collect the couple of first comments... so this is the "real" projekt.
